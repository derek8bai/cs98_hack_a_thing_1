In this project, I dip my toes into NLP by exploring the basic functionality of the nltk toolkit. Since I do not have much experience in NLP, I used this project to learn about tokenizing texts, stripping them of their stopwords, and plotting the frequency of words in a text. 

My code simply reads two separate text files containing different texts, tokenizes the texts, removes all English stopwords according to nltk.corpus, and prints the 20 most frequently used words (excluding stopwords). The program can be run via the command "python nlp_practice.py" in the terminal.
